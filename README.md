> My personal website: https://nikitas.link

In 2021 I decided to rewrite my personal website/landing page.
It was written in react (still is), but it had an unnecessary amount of javascript, and I think a simple landing page of static content shouldn't need any javascript.

However, I still like react, so I rewrote it in a slightly more modern way (I used [vite](https://vitejs.dev/)) and I created a configuration such that it can be rendered to just html/css and then deployed without any javascript.


It used to look like this:

Now it looks like this:
