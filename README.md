For my personal homepage, I thought it would be fun to make it in a style of a terminal window. I made this website using React, and Redux, and using some basic bootstrap styling. It also uses [Iconic Fonts](https://useiconic.com/open/) fonts (the licenses are located in `public/open-iconic`). It simply displays a terminal-type window with some static output. In the future I would like to add:

- make the window resizable/draggable
- make the buttons work (minimize, maxmimize, close, file, edit, etc)
- make a partial terminal emulator that allows users to enter basic commands
- add a desktop environment with draggable files
- add a task bar panel with icons that link to some of my projects
